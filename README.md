# Project: Object Counting with GUI Integration

## Description
This project is a Python application for counting objects (e.g., cars, people) in a video stream. It utilizes the YOLO object detection model for detecting and tracking objects in real-time. The application also features a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library, allowing users to interact with the program easily.

## Key Features
- Object detection and tracking using YOLO model.
- Integration of a GUI for user interaction.
- Selection of points for defining counting lines in the video.
- Real-time display of object counts in the GUI.
- Visualization of object counts over time using Matplotlib.

## Modules
1. **gui_kaspi.py**: Contains code for the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
2. **select_point.py**: Implements functionality for selecting points on the video frame for defining counting lines.
3. **main.py**: Main module integrating object detection, counting, and GUI functionalities.

## Revision History
- **Release 1 (25.04.2024)**:
  - Initial release with basic functionalities.
  - Integration of GUI using Tkinter.
  - Object counting based on YOLO object detection model.
